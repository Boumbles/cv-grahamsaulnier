I forked this repo from [Philip Thomas](https://github.com/philipithomas), a friend of mine at Washington University in St. Louis.

#My Modifications
I slightly changed the section titled 'Technical'.  I take pride in being skilled in multiple fields and so I made a quick adjustment to allow for multiple charts. This lets me clearly display my skill sets for each fields.  I also worded mine so it's clear that it's a personal assessment of my skills. 


#About

Paper resumes suck. They are inconvenient to carry around. They are boring to read. There are always multiple versions. 

I decided to turn my resume into a website to address these concerns. This makes the site easy to access, and it allows linking to various projects. The site is based on the [Spacelab Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), so design is responsive. Storing the site as a public git repository allows version control and a degree of accountability as changes are made.
