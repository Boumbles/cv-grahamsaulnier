## My CV


Live at [http://grahamsaulnier-cv.com](http://grahamsaulnier-cv.com/).



##About

This project originates from [Philip Thomas](https://www.philipithomas.com/) so I can't take credit for the idea. The rewrite into JS came from work by [andhess](https://github.com/andhess).

###Skill Ratings

A while back I had read about a self-rating system that may or may not have originated at Google. I was contacted at one point by their HR and received a [similar scaling system](https://gist.github.com/Boumbles/e66e2a55713fc818d2aa), this is what I use to rate myself in my CV.



####TODO List

* Mouseover skill level description
*  Print to PDF
 * I currently have a print to pdf branch going. I'm trying to integrate the [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) library in so readers can get a nice looking pdf from the page easily. The library's current print from the existing HTML is a bit fresh still so this feature wont' be in my main CV page just yet.
* Database support?
 * I've thought about adding some kind of database system to handle all the information, then I can more easily turn things on/off.
* Dynamic sections
 * Maybe let users chose what they want to see
* French version
